This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
#first we need to import our data using readtext. Quanteda will then let us make a corpus object from our imported txt data

library(quanteda)
library(readtext)

evolution_data_txt <-
  readtext("~/anaconda3/RStudioExperiments/Evolution_txt",
  docvarsfrom = "filenames",
  docvarnames = c("origin", "id#"),
  dvsep = "_")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
